## When i was started learning to code, then after some day I was dreamed about to start building website template. This is my first template which i have made from scratch with HTML, CSS and little bit of javascript.

The lasagna restaurant theme is a one-page template for any type of restaurants, bistros, sushi bar, fast food, casual dining, fast-casual, buffet, pop-up restaurants, and much more.

Lasagna theme is a clean and modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript theme for cafe & restaurant and any food-related business website built with the core HTML, CSS, and javascript tech stacks. Lasagna theme supports responsive layout so it looks great on all devices. It has predefined styling for modern cuisine restaurants, Asian food restaurants, and elegant food restaurants which is now ready for a sushi bar restaurant üç£üç• but you can customize it according to your business and restaurant.
